## Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) example
[Approximate Bayesian Computation example.ipynb](ABC_example/Approximate%20Bayesian%20Computation%20example.ipynb) demonstrates the method behind ABC using a 1D gaussian as an example process with the mean as a single latent parameter. As the tolerance of accepted samples increases, the posterior `p(Î¸|x)` density becomes less concentrated around the true value 0 and approachs the uniform prior.
